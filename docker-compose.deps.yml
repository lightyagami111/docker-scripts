# during development, when you are constantly changing and debugging the code, 
# itâ€™s sometimes useful to keep the app running natively outside of Docker, 
# but still running dependencies via Docker. 
# This can be achieved in the same docker-compose.yml file 
# by adding a special deps service (or however you want to call it) that will 
# just start the dependencies and exit. It can be invoked as follows:

# docker compose run deps
